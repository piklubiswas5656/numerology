    <!--Personality Number-->
    <string name="one">
        Some of their key traits are:\n\n

Confidence.\n
Loyalty.\n
Leadership skills.\n
Creativity.\n
Ones need to work on:\n\n

Their ego.\n
Their lack of compassion.\n
Being overconfident.\n
Stubbornness.\n
Ones are born leaders. Is that surprising at all? Probably not because they have an ego, and they’re stubborn about it.\n

They’re risk-taking, self-driven pioneers who fear nothing and nobody. They’re also very creative, and a creative leader is a great one, right?\n

People might not be so sure about that. Ones are so full of confidence; they scare people off. They need to calm down, approach things with less vigor and keep their ego in check. Let people who lack the confidence get close to them, as people are afraid to as ones are now.\n\n

Work compassionately, lead gently and people will flock to ones.\n
    </string>
    <string name="two">
        Some of their key traits are:

Being trustworthy.
Honesty.
Reliability.
Friendly.
Twos need to work on:

Moodiness.
Shyness.
Personality number 2s are the best kind of friends. They’re trustworthy so you can confide in them, and they’re honest. If you tell them something they don’t like they’ll let you know, but in a warm way that keeps the peace.

Twos are natural peacemakers, but they’ll fight if they have to. They’re fiery despite their shy nature. Perhaps keeping the fight inside is what makes them so moody.

Despite the moodiness, twos are talented with great ideas and are very philosophical. You may admire them for these traits, and their soft natured warmth.
    </string>
    <string name="three">
        Some of their key traits are:

Opportunistic nature.
Intuition.
Communication skills.
Creativity.
Threes need to work on:

Manipulative streak.
Threes are talkative and talented at it. They can attract people easily with excellent communication skills, and keep them with their creativity.

It’s easy for threes to make friends, maybe because of their chatty side, maybe because of their lucky streak. Or maybe it’s because threes are intelligent and opportunistic, so they know when to pounce on a person. They’re fast at making wise decisions, which makes them successful in all aspects of life.

However, threes sometimes come across as being manipulative. Even if it’s unintentional, that’s something threes need to work on.
    </string>
    <string name="four">
        Some of their key traits are:

Family-oriented.
Well-dressed.
Stability.
Maturity.
Nurturing nature.
Pragmatic.
Fours need to work on:

Being too serious.
Dull attitude.
Fours make for the perfect gentlefolk. They’re organized, well dressed, and are very close to their family. They’re the types of well put together people that others turn to in a crisis.

Personality number 4s are very mature, even from a young age. They’re pragmatic in their outlook, consistent in their actions and they dominate any scenario. But they won’t put you down if you don’t match their stable, unshakeable ways. They’re very nurturing towards others and make for excellent managers, helpers and guides.

However, their pragmatic, systematic outlook in life makes them come across as boring. They’re too serious and need to learn to loosen up a little.
    </string>
    <string name="five">
        Some of their key traits are:

High spirited.
Travel enthusiast.
Adaptable.
Fives need to work on:

Over-burdening.
Fives are a joy to know. Their spirits are so high it’s breathtaking, and they love to travel. What else would a risk-taker who loves life do, right?

Personality number 5 people can handle almost any challenge, and they’ll fight zestily if anything goes awry. They’re very good at handling change and challenges, positive and negative. The positive changes they like are trends and pop culture, but the negatives could be anything.

Fives only falter when they work too hard when something goes wrong. They tend to overburden themselves, whether it’s at work or being everyone’s shoulder to cry on.
    </string>
    <string name="six">
        Some of their key traits are:

Warmth.
Well-balanced.
Responsible.
Caring.
Sixes need to work on:

Over-worrying.
Financial frivolity.
Vulnerability.
Sixes are generous beings who like caring for others. They’re friendly, so they’ll be warm and loving towards anyone right away. They’re so beautiful on the inside and care more about a person’s inside than outside.

However, sixes are very vulnerable when criticized and would do well to toughen up. They also tend to worry a lot, especially over money. They’re not particularly logical when it comes to their spending habits.
    </string>
    <string name="seven">
        Some of their key traits are:

Intelligence.
Rationality.
Dignified.
Sevens need to work on:

Reserved attitude.
Unemotional nature.
Sevens are intelligent, dignified people. Some might go as far as to call them scholars. No matter what the situation, they react with dignity and rationality.

Personality number 7 people make wonderful poets, aided by their intelligence and the air of mystery about them. Their work may be quirky, as are they, and they don’t care if you find it strange.

Although this confidence they have in themselves can sometimes be a downer. Sevens are used to people mocking their mysterious ways, their odd dress sense and their poetry. So they’ve adopted a reserved and “don’t-care” attitude about all aspects of life. Some people find this unappealing.
    </string>
    <string name="eight">
        Some of their key traits are:

Amazing judgment.
Successful.
Intuitive.
Controlled.
Eights need to work on:

Show-offiness.
Dominating people.
Eights are great judges of character. Their intuition is powerful, so they know the types of people they should be around. Because of this and their strong, self-controlled nature, they’re very successful in life.

However, their strong and controlled attitude may come across as too dominating to others, so they may shy away. They may also be disliked for showing off expensive things, like designer clothes. Eights can be very materialistic at times.

Though eights are persuasive when they want their way, they are not easily swayed by others.
    </string>
    <string name="nine">
        Some of their key traits are:

Influential.
Magnetic.
Charming.
Confidence.
Philanthropic.
Nines need to work on:

Being aloof.
Entitlement.
Nines are adored by many. They’re elegant, charismatic and graceful by nature. They have a raw magnetism that draws people in.

They keep people close with ease because they’re so well-versed, and their confidence is catching. But nines need to be careful because confidence can turn to cockiness in seconds.

Some nines even get aloof and start acting arrogant and self-entitled, with the more positive attention they get. It’s not ideal for an influential and charming person to come across in this manner.
